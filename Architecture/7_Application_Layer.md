# Application Layer

PPIO’s APIs are designed to enable third-party developers to build all kinds of applications, including but not limited to the following:

- **Storage Applications**
  - Private data storage. Due to its decentralized nature, PPIO storage network is very suitable for private network storage applications. Personal data is partioned, encrypted and stored on different nodes to ensure high level of privacy protection. At the same time, access to the data is restricted by user’s private key, making personal data assets even more secure.
  - Enterprise data storage: PPIO can provide significant cost savings for enterprise data storage, while providing high performance services. At the same time, its interfaces are compatible to those of the existing data storage services such as AWS S3, and makes migration to PPIO much easier.

- **DApps:**  
Storing application data on the blockchain is very expensive for decentralized applications. Smart contracts, or other application data can be stored on external storage by utilizing PPIO’s APIs, in order to achieve significant cost saving.  
For example:
  - Social DApps: PPIO can help validate the identity of users and their messages, it can also help keeping the conversations private.
  - Ads system: Besides storing the advertisement content, PPIO can also help accurately calculating and reporting the statistics of Ad access, such as the click-through-rate. As such data is usually the basis of ads payment, its accuracy and transparency has always been an issue for traditional ads platforms. Businesses may not be able to validate the statistics reported, to make sure they are paying for the actual exposure of the ads, and understand real user preference. PPIO can easily resolve these problems.
  - Traceability Apps: Supply chain or other DApps that require reliable and verifiable data storage.

- **Media Applications:** PPIO provides cost effective bandwidth resource that can help reduce the cost of content distribution significantly. PPIO is also equipped with scheduling and transmission algorithms specifically optimized to achieve smooth streaming playback. Along with its PCDN caching for on-demand content distribution, and cross network acceleration for real-time broadcasting, high quality user experience can be achieved and maintained for media applications. At the same time, PPIO can provide reliable statistics on content consumption that are valuable marketing data for these applications.

- **Data Exchange:** File assets can be traded in PPIO’s network. PPIO can provide ways to match the sellers and buyers, and handle transactions in a secure and reliable way, without requiring an intermediate party. Commonly used applications such as application market and content platforms can benefit from using PPIO.

- **Data Warehouse:** PPIO can be used as enterprise data warehouse, to store a huge amount of historical data, and replace traditional unreliable local data storage or expensive cloud storage. Besides enterprise data, PPIO can also be used to store public database such as a gene pool.

For other types of storage needs, PPIO will also provide the necessary support. In addtion, PPIO will be open sourced in the near future. At that time, App enthusiasts and developers will be able to participate in PPIO's development and add support for many more applications.
