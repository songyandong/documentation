# PPIO wallet
## Introduction
PPIO wallet is a decentralized blockchain-based wallet. And PPIO wallet account is your user credentials for using PPIO services. PPIO wallet does not have a centralized organization and you wallet can only be transferred with your own private key.

Now that PPIO's testnet is just online, you can go to [here](https://faucet.testnet.pp.io) to get some test coins for your PPIO wallet account.

> If you don't understand the concept of blockchain wallet, there will be a lot of articles on Google.

## One thing to Notice
One thing to notice is that even if you have [PPcoin](#unit-in-ppio-wallet) in your PPIO wallet account, it doesn't mean you can use PPIO's service immediately. You need to recharge the money for a specific PPIO wallet address before you can use it. We call the specific PPIO wallet address **holder account**.

**For example: If you want to use PPIO CLI, you must first recharge the money into the PPIO wallet and then recharge the money to holder account.**

This kind of processing is troublesome, but it is more in line with the idea of decentralization, and even if the PPIO service is attacked, it will not affect your wallet.

## Generate a PPIO wallet account

::: warning NOTE
Your **keystore file** and **passphrase** is your user credentials to use all PPIO services such as POSS. Except you, there is no centralized organization to keep them. **You should keep them safe.**

## Get wallet address

If someone wants to transfer money to your PPIO wallet, you can send this address to them. This address is publicly available and there is no risk.

## Get private key

This private key is very important and cannot be made public. Once the private key is compromised, your account is very dangerous.
