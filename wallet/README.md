If someone wants to transfer money to your PPIO wallet, you can send this address to them. This address is publicly available and there is no risk.

## Get private key & keystore file

This private key and the keystore file are very important and cannot be made public. Once the private key is compromised, your account is very dangerous.

## PPIO Official Account
PPIO wallet is your digital wallet. But if you want to use PPIO's storage service, you must recharge some PPcoin to a PPIO Official Account to purchase these services. This kind of processing is troublesome, but it is more in line with the idea of decentralization, and even if the PPIO service is attacked, it will not affect your wallet.

::: warning IMPORTANT
PPIO Official Account is a specific PPIO account. You have to recharge some PPcoin to **PPIO Official account** => `ppio1RrvoTasB3n96sFFxBUr4dbVheATVrrPYZ` to use PPIO services.
