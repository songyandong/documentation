# Getting Started

## What is PPIO?
**PPIO** is a decentralized programmable storage and delivery network. You can use **PPIO** to store and retrieve **any amount of data** at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the [PPIO SDK <badge text="todo" type="warn" vertical="" />](./PPIO_SDK.md) or [PPIO Command Line Tool](../cli/)(abbreviated as CLI in the following content). This guide introduces how to use PPIO Command Line Tool to complete the tasks.

PPIO is similar to the existing cloud-based storage services such as AWS S3 in terms of usage and function. But it is more robust, efficient and offers better privacy protection. It also reduces cost significantly. PPIO's well-designed blockchain-based incentives allow it to make use of the vast amount of unused bandwidth and storage resources on the Internet, and to provide robust storage service at much lower cost.

PPIO's unique decentralized file system prevents unauthorized access and ensures that all the data can be stored in secure and private manner.

PPIO is designed from the ground up to perform efficiently on a global scale, by leveraging the experience of the [founding team - PPLabs](./others/About_PPLabs.md). The team designed and ran decentralized network with hundreds of millions of users before. PPIO meets the storage needs of both today's Internet businesses and services, and the emerging decentralized applications (DApps).

## Installation CLI
We can't wait to let you experience PPIO for the first time at the end of this year. Like a child can't wait to show off his painting. Currently, we are on the final testing process of platform stability and data security to insure you the best experience.

You can learn more about PPIO through our demo videos.

1. **PPIO demo video in September 2018**

  As the first demo for the PPIO, we will demonstrate some basic distributed storage functionalities of the PPIO, such as put or get an object. We will see the following actions:  
      - The introduction of the two users and two miners nodes
      - Uploading the files from the user to the miner
      - Downloading the file from the miner to the user

2. **PPIO demo video in October 2018**

  This demo introduces the relationship between the PPIO blockchain and distributed storage. It starts up a local test network, spawns two users and two miners nodes, runs upload and download actions, then inspects the corresponding settlement results. The demo shows:  
      - The introduction of the service nodes in PPIO
      - Transfer tokens from PPIO blockchain to distributed storage
      - User uploads file and the settlement result
      - User downloads file and the settlement result
