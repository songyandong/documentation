# Getting Started

## What is PPIO?
**PPIO** is a decentralized programmable storage network based on **blockchain**. You can use **PPIO** to store and retrieve **any amount of data** at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the [PPIO SDK <badge text="todo" type="warn" vertical="" />](./PPIO_SDK.md) or PPIO [PPIO Command Line Tool](../cli/)(abbreviated as CLI in the following content). This guide introduces you how to use PPIO Command Line Tool complete the tasks.

In order to better understand PPIO, you better know that PPIO is similar to the existing cloud-based storage services such as AWS S3 in terms of use and function. But it is more robust, efficient and offers better privacy protection and significant cost saving. PPIO's well-designed blockchain-based incentives allow it to make use of the vast amount of unused bandwidth and storage resources on the Internet, and provide robust storage service at much lower cost.

PPIO's unique decentralized file system prevents unauthorized access and ensures that all the data can be stored in a secure and private manner.

PPIO is designed from the ground up to perform efficiently on a global scale, by leveraging the [founding team - PPLabs'](./others/About_PPLabs.md) experience from designing and running decentralized network with hundreds of millions of users. PPIO meets the storage needs of both today's Internet businesses and services, and the emerging decentralized applications (DApps).

If you are interested in why we want to design PPIO, check out the [Why Do We Design PPIO](./others/Why_Do_Want_To_Design_PPIO.md).

## Installation CLI
We can't wait to let you experience PPIO for the first time, just like a child can't wait to show off his perfect score. But for the stability of the service, for the security of the data, in order to give you a better experience, we are still in the process of internal testing.We promise that you experience PPIO in December of this year.

You can learn about PPIO by watching the video we recorded during the test.
