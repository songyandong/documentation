# About PPLabs

PPLabs is a global technology community organization initiated by former PPLive start-up team members **Elnino (PPLive CTO)** and **BillYao (PPLive CEO)**.

PPLabs' founding team successfully developed PPLive, which is the worldâ€˜s only P2P data storage and transmission network that operates on more than 500 million nodes, which is one tenth of the operation cost of traditional network, which has reached 40PB in P2P storage capacity and continues to supply about 10TB of bandwidth resources through 1% of user resources.

And certainly PPLabs' founding team has deep technical accumulation in the field of P2P network design and efficient data transmission technologies[1][2][3][4]. By leveraging the experience, PPIO's P2P network is designed to be a robust, scalable and high-performing data storage and transmission system.

At present, PPlabs has absorbed members from Alibaba, IBM, Huawei and security companies, located in Silicon Valley, Singapore, Shanghai, China and other places.
