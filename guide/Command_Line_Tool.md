# Command Line Tool
## Overview
You can use the command line tool to perform all the operations you want to perform with PPIO.

## Installation  
We can't wait to let you experience PPIO for the first time, just like a child can't wait to show off his perfect score. But for the stability of the service, for the security of the data, in order to give you a better experience, we are still in the process of internal testing.

**We promise that you experience PPIO in December of this year.**

You can learn about PPIO by watching the video we recorded during the test.
